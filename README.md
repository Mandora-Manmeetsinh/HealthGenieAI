  ▫️ Enhance accessibility: Make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, including students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector.
  
  ▫️ Promote awareness and understanding: Foster a deeper appreciation for traditional herbal practices and their role in healthcare.
